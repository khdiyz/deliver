Here's a basic `README.md` file for your GitHub repository that includes instructions for building and running your Docker containers with `docker-compose`:

```markdown
# Food Delivery Service

## Overview

Brief description of your project and its purpose.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and Docker Compose from [docs.docker.com/compose/install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khdiyz/deliver.git
   cd deliver
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Images**

   Run the following command to build the Docker images as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Start the Containers**

   After the build is complete, start the containers with:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will start your application and any associated services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Usage

Provide instructions for using your application once the containers are running. This might include accessing the web application via a browser or making API requests.

## Configuration

List any configuration options or environment variables that users may need to set up. 

## Stopping the Containers

To stop the running containers, you can use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command will stop and remove the containers.
